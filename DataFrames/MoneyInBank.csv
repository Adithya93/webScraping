@PatsyvS welke crew?
Arja vd Berg heeft ons rondgeleid op haar tentoonstelling. Kleine groep uitverkorenen. Was blij dat ik er bij mocht.
Vandaag van VenetiÃ« naar huis. Maandag echte start bij het Rijksvastgoedbedrijf. Ik ben er klaar voor.
Eindelijk een mooi weekeinde en nog een (digitale) stapel werkt te doen. Zal het moeten combineren.
2E dag nieuwe baan Heel erg leuk, zeer nuttig , maar voor ik de namen en afkortingen ken ben ik een stuk verder gestrompeld.
@carolienrest soms zijn ze het doel even vergeten
Het is zo koud
Wandelen met 15  vriendinnen en vrienden op de veluwe. Het vriest en waait. Wel mooi.
@mvanrooij geriatrisch probleem?
@PatsyvS wie is die kleine?
Vorig jaar was geweldig tot het einde. 2013 is mooi begonnen.
Kerst in Ootmarsum gevierd met 8 vrienden en vriendinnen. Verhalen van decennia geleden opgehaald. Was gezellig.
Handtekening gezet voor oplevering gebouw. Na bijna 10 jaar voorbereiding. Nu nog 5000 ambtenaren er in.
PAN Amsterdam, wanneer alle belangrijke zaken met vrienden, familie en gezondheid zijn geregeld, kun je genieten van het minder belangrijke
Gistermiddag het gebouw aan 2 ministers laten zien. In de lift roept een bouwvakker, we staan hier met HEEL beroemde mensen.
Gebouw is bijna af. Wordt een drukke december.
@PatsyvS even snel op en neer naar IJlst rennen
@bvs911 ziet er geweldig uit Hoe komt ze hier bij?
