The seamless integration of Colt's IT, network and data centre services will offer customers the ability to optimize their IT strategy in a way that is second to none.

We also taught a class together at UBC on Green marketing and how the efforts done by our two companies in terms of sustainability ultimately helped the brand in its marketing efforts , building credibility, loyalty and a high level of engagement of our customers.
