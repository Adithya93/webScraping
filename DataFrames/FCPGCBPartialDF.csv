In addition to promoting the adoption of best practice design and operational standards, our primary role is to act as a Accreditation Body for these standards.

The current Data Centre footprint consists of 20 Data Centres accross 10 countries in Europe with sites in all the major cities in Europe. 2012 revenues across the Data Centre Services Unit amounted to ca. Eur 105m.   Given the quality of the data centres, the strategic locations and Colt's ability to deliver new Data Centres on customer premises where needed with guaranteed (short!) delivery times, the focus will now be on integrating the data centre portfolio into the overall Colt portfolio. The seamless integration of Colt's IT, network and data centre services will offer customers the ability to optimize their IT strategy in a way that is second to none. This optimisation will not only lead to reduced operating costs but also to a more effective and efficient IT infrastructure.

Targeting my member is now going to be a much more precise exercise.  Thank you Lindsey for helping us navigate all this with gusto ! Selena has been my right hand at MEC since day one. She has a very unique mix of strong strategic sense with the ability to create some strong operational programs.  She brings in a very keen sense of research , and set up a 5000 member panel which has been instrumental in allowing us to develop more targeted prograns for our members  Maria and I have worked together several times , in particular we presented at a conference on the topic of community marketing and how both her brand Nature Path and MEC had become quite adept at creating a large community of loyal followers.  We also taught a class together at UBC on Green marketing and how the efforts done by our two companies in terms of sustainability ultimately helped the brand in its marketing efforts , building credibility, loyalty and a high level of engagement of our customers.  Both times I have found Maria to be a very skilled communicator, very thorough in her preparation and a lot of fun to work with .  Can't wait for a new opportunity to happen ! I am very happy to be able to recommend Charlotte and her work at Patagonia as Marketing Assistant for the UK market . Charlotte started as an intern and her vivacious personality , her superb implementation talent made her quickly a legitimate part of the Marketing department.  Charlotte was responsible for all communication and marketing activities for the UK market. She liaised with customer service which allowed her to quickly understand the business. Under her leadership the contacts with the Press in the UK multiplied and projected a very positive image for Patagonia.","IEP 2001, International Executive program ( General management); Master's degree (CAPES), Foreign languages","INSEAD; ","Corporate Communications, Strategy, Public Relations, Marketing Communications, Marketing, Strategic Communications, E-commerce, Marketing Strategy, Management, Team Building, Direct Marketing, Branding & Identity, Leadership, Strategic Planning, Social Media, Internal Communications, Event Management, Web Strategy, French, Corporate Social..., Retail, Brand Development, Sales, Online Marketing, Business Strategy, Advertising, Social Media Marketing, Brand Management, Program Management, Digital Marketing, Team Management, retail, Mountain Products","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"La capitale mondiale de l'autopartage - LaPresse+ http://t.co/9mUzKniAnd via @lp_lapresse

We vinden snel onze plek binnen nieuwe organisaties en functioneren vaak als echte spin-in-het-web. We leggen verrassende verbanden en springen graag in het diepe. Daarnaast zijn we inhoudelijke sparringpartners die snel kunnen schakelen en nemen we je werk uit handen waar nodig. Dit doen we onder andere binnen de ruimtelijke sector, de zorg en het onderwijs. S.V. Kampong is de grootste omni-sportvereniging van Nederland met ongeveer 5.000 leden. Als lid van de sponsorcommissie van Kampong Voetbal werkte ik mee aan de acquisitie van nieuwe sponsoren, de organisatie van evenementen en de interne communicatie van Kampong Voetbal. Ik heb meegewerkt aan de ontwikkeling van een projectmanagementtool voor de realisatiefase van (bouw)projecten. Mijn werkzaamheden bestonden uit het ondersteunen van het projectteam, het beheren van de social media, het uitwerken van nieuwe functies en het aansturen van de programmeurs. Voor Stichting Studentensport Nederland onderhield ik de social media pagina's. Daarnaast schreef ik de nieuwsbrieven en updates en maakte ik verslagen van verschillende studentensport evenementen in Nederland.   Tijdens mijn tweejarige stage bij Olympisch Vuur 2028 heb ik meegewerkt aan het speerpunt 'Economische Impact' (voorheen Ruimtelijke Ambitie) van het Olympisch Plan 2028. Ik ben betrokken geweest bij het traject 'Keuze Stad' voor een mogelijke Olympische Spelen in 2028 en ik heb samen met twee collega's een plan van aanpak geschreven voor een Young Ambassadors project in Nederland. Een vergelijkbaar project is gestart in het Verenigd Koninkrijk in 2006 voor het Londen bid. Idee achter het programma is dat jongeren zorgen voor kansen, betrokkenheid en verandering voor andere jongeren door middel van sport en fysieke activiteiten. In de laatste vier maanden van mijn bachelor Bestuurs- en Organisatiewetenschap heb ik kwantitatief onderzoek gedaan bij de gemeente Leerdam op het gebied van Human Resource Management. Ik heb onderzocht welke factoren verschillen verklaren in de mate van public service motivation (motivatie voor de publieke zaak) van ambtenaren. Uit de data komt een sterk positief significant verband tussen het hebben van een open organisatiecultuur en public service motivation. Ook het aantal dienstjaren heeft een positief significant verband. De gehele bachelorthesis vindt u via onderstaande link:   http://ebookbrowse.com/bachelor-scriptie-mike-molkenboer-pdf-d98773268 Voor het JSO jaarcongres op 9 oktober 2014 verrichtte ik organisatorische, ondersteunende en inhoudelijke werkzaamheden. Voor het project Provinciale Samenwerking Jeugdzorgorganisaties (PSJ) beschreef ik goede voorbeelden vanuit vijf jeugdzorgorganisaties in Zuid-Holland Zuid voor de website ''transformatrix.nl''. Daarnaast beheerde ik de content en verrichtte ik ondersteunende werkzaamheden voor Juletta Vruggink en Kees Verhaar. Vanuit Stek Jeugdhulp ondersteunde ik de directeur, Thea Roelofs, tijdens de werkgroepen Arrangementen Midden-Holland in het kader van het vormgeven van het Regionaal Transitie Arrangement Midden-Holland. Naast het zijn van sparringspartner bestonden mijn werkzaamheden uit vergaderingen voorbereiden en uitwerken, rapporteren en de eindpresentatie verzorgen. Om inzicht te krijgen in de kosten en in de werkwijze van het huidige stelsel indicatiestelling bij het CIZ voerde ik een onderzoek uit in de regio Goeree-Overflakkee. Ik nam telefonische interviews af en schreef het onderzoeksrapport. Om duidelijk te krijgen welke gegevens wel (en niet) voor gemeenten nodig zijn ten behoeve van hun regierol op de sociale domeinen hielp ik mee een onderzoek uit te voeren.  Ik maakte deel uit van het communicatieteam van JongeHonden. Wij schreven de nieuwsbrieven & blogs, beheerde de sociale media en bedachten marketing campagnes.  JSO werkt samen met onderzoeksbureau Tympaan om de provincie Zuid-Holland te helpen bij de vraag hoe de provincie, ondanks de fysieke kerntaken, rekening kan houden met sociale kwaliteit. Ik ondersteun de adviseurs door mee te denken en te schrijven aan projectplannen en te notuleren bij overleggen op het provinciehuis.  Voor de UPvA stonden in de maand september twee visitaties op de planning. Ik ondersteunde de directeur tijdens de (proef)visitatiedagen en verrichte verschillende werkzaamheden om alles in goede banen te leiden.  Samen met een jurist, een HRM specialist en een bestuurder van FNV bouw maakte ik deel uit van de bezwarencommissie van woningcorporatie Mooiland tijdens een reorganisatie. Ik voerde organisatorische werkzaamheden uit en was de schakel tussen de organisatie, de bezwarencommissie, en de bezwaarmakers.  Voor het project Agenda Stad (waarin Platform31 onder andere samenwerkt met BZK, I&M en Ruimtevolk) voer ik een deskresearch uit naar internationale en nationale steden die om welke reden dan ook gezien worden als een succes. Ik label de steden om toe te werken naar een database. Uiteindelijk kunnen de succesverhalen gebruikt worden om een doorvertaling te maken naar de Nederlandse praktijk.   Voor het project Sociale Kwaliteit heb ik mee geschreven aan de verkenning ''Omgaan met groene burgerinitiatieven''. De verkenning gaat in op de provinciale betrokkenheid bij maatschappelijke initiatieven in het groen. Het beschrijft de visie en doelen, de betrokkenheid en de (toekomstige) rol van de provincies ten aanzien van burgerinitiatieven in het groen. De verkenning is van belang om op dit...more Samen met Jooske Baris van Platform31 organiseer ik in het kader van Agenda Stad een stadslab in Maastricht over grensoverschrijdende samenwerking.

Ook verzorg ik de facturen- en uren administratie en schrijf ik mee aan inhoudelijke stukken waar Monique verantwoordelijk voor is.  InteraktContour is er voor mensen die problemen ervaren als gevolg van hersenletsel, na bijvoorbeeld een beroerte, ongeluk of hersentumor. We ontwikkelen door middel van scrum een nieuw handboek met verschillende modules voor dagbesteding om nog beter aan te sluiten bij de doelen van de client.
