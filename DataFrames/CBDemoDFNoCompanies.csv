An information handling system can include a base, a printed circuit board including a capacitive switch, and a cover. The printed circuit board can be attached to the base, and the cover can lie adjacent to the printed circuit board. The capacitive switch can be configured to change state when an object is close to the cover. The cover can be configured such that it can be detached from the remainder of the information handling system while the printed circuit board remains attached to the base. The configuration of the printed circuit board and cover can be particularly useful when maintaining a keyboard or a touch pad or when replacing the cover. An information handling system (IHS) includes an IHS chassis defining a drive bay. A processor is located in the IHS chassis. A drive chassis is located in the drive bay. A bezel extends from an edge of the drive chassis. A first connector coupling is located on the bezel. An IHS connector is located on the drive chassis and electrically coupled to the processor and the connector coupling such that a device may be coupled to the IHS through a cable connected to the first connector coupling. A portable information handling system's integrated keyboard stows keys into a retracted position when the portable information handling system transitions from an open to a closed position, such as by rotating a lid to a closed position relative to a chassis having the keyboard. A cover plate disposed in the keyboard engages the keyboard keys to retract the keys into the information handling system when the lid of the information handling system rotates to a closed position and releases the keys to be biased out from the information handling systems when the lid rotates to an open position. A display assembly includes a display bezel. A display is mounted to the display bezel. A display cable is coupled to the display. A display cover is coupled to the display bezel such that the display cover is operable to be decoupled from the display bezel while the display remains mounted to the display bezel and the display cable remains coupled to the display. The display cover may then be removed and personalized or replaced with a personalized display cover quickly and easily.. Shipment and storage of systems poses integrity and economical issues. Such systems may require substantial packaging to protect components of the system during shipment and storage. Some components, such as a battery, may need to be separated from the system during shipment to prevent either actual or perceived damage by the user of the system. A battery directly connected to a system may discharge so as to be incapable of providing sufficient power to the system. Users may erroneously believe that the system is defective and place unnecessary service calls. Such service calls increase costs and affect future business activity. Configuring the terminals of high current connectors coupled to the battery and the system allow for an isolator to be inserted between the high current connectors to prevent conduction while allowing the connectors to mate which results in feasibly shipping the battery in tact within the system.  An electrical plug is disclosed with a slidable earth pin that can be manually positioned in a stored position in a plug body of the electrical plug when the electrical plug is not in use. The slidable earth pin is movable in the channel and retained by an interlocking mechanism between the earth pin and the channel on the plug body. The earth pin has a pair of protruding fingers that snap into a first set of grooves in the channel of the plug body in a first position, and that snap into a second set of grooves in the channel of the plug body in a second or stored position. When the earth pin is in its stored position, the physical dimension of the plug is significantly more compact than conventional three pin plugs.  An electrical plug is disclosed having a rotatable earth pin that can be folded into a plug body by rotating the rotatable earth pin from an unfolded position to a folded position. In the unfolded position, the rotatable earth pin is interlocked with the plug body through a locking tab on a snap lock that latches onto the plug body. To release the rotatable earth pin from its unfolded position, pressure is exerted onto the locking tab to release the snap lock, which allows the rotatable earth pin to move and rotate to a folded position. Locking pins and associated grooves releasably retain the rotatable earth pin in its folded position. An input system for use with an information handling system is disclosed. The input system may include a display device having a viewing area defined by a perimeter, a graphic user interface configured to display an input option within the viewing area adjacent the perimeter, a frame adjacent the perimeter of the viewing area, and a proximity sensing element associated with the frame and located outside the viewing area of the display device. The proximity sensing element may be configured to sense a user selecting the input option indicated by the graphic user interface. An information handling system can include a base, a printed circuit board including a capacitive switch, and a cover. The printed circuit board can be attached to the base, and the cover can lie adjacent to the printed circuit board. The capacitive switch can be configured to change state when an object is close to the cover. The cover can be configured such that it can be detached from the remainder of the information handling system while the printed circuit board remains attached to the base. The configuration of the printed circuit board and cover can be particularly useful when maintaining a keyboard or a touch pad or when replacing the cover. A metal laminate assembly includes a plastic film and a metal film bonded together using a pressure-sensitive adhesive between them. The bonded films may be formed into a desired shape. A plastic part is formed to the bonded films using a single-shot in-mold film molding system. Accordingly, the laminate assembly has the plastic part on a first side and the metal film on a second side, opposite the first side of the assembly. Dual operation centrifugal fan apparatus and methods of operating same that may be used, for example, to cool the internal heat-generating components of an information handling system or other device. The dual operation centrifugal fan apparatus may be implemented in one embodiment as a self-cleaning blower apparatus that is operated in a first normal cooling direction to dissipate heat from internal components of an information handling system, and operated in second cleaning direction to reverse airflow and expel accumulated dust from the interior of the information handling system. An information handling system (IHS) chassis defines a component housing. An IHS component is located in the component housing. The IHS component defines a module channel, a module chassis locating slot adjacent the module channel, and a pair of module chassis securing apertures adjacent the module channel. The IHS component includes a module chassis retaining surface that is spaced apart from the module channel. A module chassis is located in the module channel, includes a retaining wall that engages the module chassis retaining surface and a locating member that extends into the module chassis locating slot, and defines a module housing. The module chassis is secured to the component through the pair of module chassis securing apertures. A latching module is located in the module housing and secured to the module chassis. The latching module engages the IHS chassis to resist removal of the IHS component from the component housing. A securing system includes a base member. A display member is rotatably coupled to the base member by a shaft. A locking member is operable to move axially relative to the shaft and engage the display member in order to restrict the display member from rotating relative to the base member. The base member and the display member may be part of an information handling system (IHS). A lock including a cable that is coupled to a stationary object may be used to secure the IHS to the stationary object and prevent the use of the IHS by positioning the lock in the base member in order to move the locking member such that it engages the display member. A beverage dispensing unit for preparing and dispensing beverages includes both a heating unit and a cooling unit for heating or cooling of a water supply source. The heating unit and cooling unit having a valve disposed therebetween that controls or restricts the flow from either the heating unit or the cooling unit.

Understanding Performance Management systems implementation is critical for multinationals operating in countries with contrasting cultures. For firms interested in Mexico, we share our findings on how successful companies tackle the problematic nature of performance management in practice. First, problems derive from difficulties in defining the content of what is perceived and apprised as performance. Second, problems arise because superior and subordinate face a culturally subjective situation that is difficult to manage: providing and receiving feedback about performance. Subjacent in effective performance management practices is the assumption that improving employee performance will help grow organizational performance, thus appraisal systems acquire strategic importance.

In a Computer Engineering (CE) curriculum, such integration must include elements of software and hardware design merged in a culminating experience that solves a representative problem, while employing engineering standards and realistic constraints. In this paper we describe the academic setting that made possible this integration through a capstone course structure and project that accommodate the requirements of realistic design experiences without the burden of a multi-semester course addition to the CE curriculum. It presents preliminary courses in Software Engineering and Microprocessor Interfacing that led to this experience, insight into the complexity of the chosen problem, and summarizes the learning experience from the perspectives of both students and professors in hopes that others could benefit from this model.

The role of the forum was to consult with interested parties on what at that time was the new proposed employment legislation, and make recommendations to the Social Security President and Committee who had political responsibility for bringing the proposed legislation to the States. This involved finding consensus between the significantly different views of employer representatives, Trade Unions, Government etc. This required a large degree of political sensitivity, as support was needed from the primary States committees at the time, including Policy and Resources, Finance and Industries, whilst also ensuring that Trade Unions and associated trade bodies maintained both their engagement with the process and provided public support for the new laws. This work culminated in the successful introduction of the Islands primary Employment legislation including the creation of the Tribunal system and JACs, providing the foundations for the current Employment Law environment.","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Program Management, Project Management, Management, Performance Management, Risk Management, Team Leadership, Business Strategy, Change Management, Strategic Planning, Employee Relations, Human Resources, Training, Policy, Leadership, Strategy, New Business Development, Coaching, Management Consulting, Organizational..., Project Planning","16","Institute of Directors - Members Only; Human Resource Professionals in the Utility and Energy Industries; HR.com; Performance Management - HR; Digital Jersey; Locate Jersey; Linked:HR (#1 Human Resources Group); Smart Grid Executive Forum; Power and Energy Jobs Board - PowerJobsDirect; CIPD member; Electric Utilities HR Metrics Group; International HR Specialists; Acas Employee Relations and HR advice; States of Jersey; Human Resource Management; JERSEY PROFESSIONAL","","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 2","0.50","0.41","0.26","Jersey, United Kingdom",NA,NA

Aiming to contribute to CAFTA-DR authorities' efforts to identify trade facilitation challenges and solutions, these institutions, independently and in the context of the IDB-USCC Memorandum of Understanding, developed a survey and conducted focus groups on trade facilitation priorities in the CAFTA-DR region, aiming to refine and consolidate private sector recommendations to governments. Based on the issues identified through these joint efforts, this report recommends a series of measures that would have a positive and sizable impact on the flow of goods and services in the CAFTA-DR region. This paper focuses on carbon-intensive export industries in Latin America and the Caribbean in order to analyze how climate change mitigation policies in the developed countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) influence trade patterns in developing countries. In particular, it examines Latin American's exposure to potential embodied carbon tariffs and the region's response and actions to avoid said tariffs. The carbon-intensive industries in Latin America were chosen as examples based on the list of industrial sectors identified as ""exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage"" in the European Commission Decision at the end of 2009.","","Georgetown University Law Center - Paris Sorbonne","Unknown","International Trade Law, International Trade, International Law, International Relations, Spanish, Policy Analysis, International..., Emerging Markets, Latin America, Public Policy, Economics, Economic Development, English, Foreign Policy, International Economics, Government","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 3","0.50","0.07","0.36","Washington D.C.

They are typically less visible than the usual business cycle related indicators, but far more important over the longer term. A key meta economic trend that is reshaping the future of the global economy is the ending of China's current growth model, which will have far-reaching ramifications.   Slower growth in global demand will post serious challenges to many emerging markets, especially ones that are more export-oriented. Stronger and more dynamic domesitc demand is needed to mitigate the weaker external demand. In this regard, the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community will transform Southeast Asia into a powerful regional economic bloc with accelerating intra-ASEAN trade and investment; while elevating consumption demand for this region of 600 million population. The ASEAN Economic Community will have what it takes to hold its own in the global economy.  Is the party over for emerging markets? From a broader historical perspective, the great convergence was preceded by the great divergence, and both are governed by the same economic dynamics. In this context, the economic growth engine can be seen as having four cylinders, when working well together, delivers robust and sustainable growth. For emerging markets to converge with the developed economies in today's tougher global economic environment, inclusive growth is the new benchmark of success; it is the critical pre-condition for setting into motion a virtuous circle for the four cylinders of the economic growth engine to function smoothly to generate sustained and balanced growth.  Inclusive growth will be the new success criterion for emerging markets in the coming decade. The global economic environment has changed fundamentally since the 2008/09 global financial crisis; and conditions of easy money and credit that pushed up growth of emerging markets everywhere has disappeared. Emerging markets will have to work harder and smarter to sustain robust growth in the new global economic environment. Inclusive growth is one of the key prerequisites for success. The Inclusive Growth Index the abilities and potential of 60 of the world's most important emerging markets to generate inclusive growth in the coming years.  Ever since China's economic opening in the early 1980s, there is the question of how far the Chinese Communist Party can push economic reform without giving up its monopoly of political power. Answers tend to come in two opposite extremes; either economic growth will eventually crash without democracy, or China's Communist Party has invented a new and successful form of state capitalism. Both are wrong. We argue that there is a middle path which is to focus on the rule of law, which should come before democracy. And it turns out that there are profound history lessons learned in how the rule of law led the evolution of democracy in Britain.  The global economy is moving into a multi-speed future, a 180 degrees turn around from the synchronized growth of the pre-crisis decade. Growth diagnostics is becoming more complex for both emerging markets and the developed economies. Successful economies in the future will have in common robust and dynamic domestic demand, with its two key components of domestic investment and domestic consumption forming a virtuous mutually reinforcing circle. Domestic demand will be a powerful lens through which to examine market prospects in a multi-speed global economy.  A more accurate term for the so called Arab Spring is youthquake. It was the demographic of a massive youth bulge, combined with social and economic marginalization and the rapid spread of social media that led to the political upheaval in the Middle East and North African region; which continues today. From an economic development perspective, it is the lack of inclusive growth that is at the root of the problem. This report assesses the state of inclusive growth of the key countries in this vast region, and evaluate their respective enabling conditions that could generate better inclusive growth in the future.

The book provides a precise road map on how to successfully start a new career. E.g.: What is the role of a marketing manager? How my work will be assessed? What could my career path be? What are the key lessons for a new graduate to learn? These and other relevant questions are answered in this book in the adventures and misadventures of Leo Mas--new college graduate.   The focus of this paper is the application of IT solutions together with methods of process improvement to manage customer requirements. According to the terminology of the ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 12207 Software process standard, the area covered by the initiative of process improvement is the User Requirements Definition. The paper is based on an actual process improvement initiative conducted for six months in a small Italian software company which produces accounting and income tax returns packages.  The results were also presented as a case study to the European ESPRIT Project 21461 TBPTIME, with the objective to collect and diffuse a set of significant case studies of process improvements for SMEs in different process areas for future training purposes.

This race will be held on Saturday August 24th, 2013. THIS IS THE MOST INSANE OPEN WATER SWIM EVENT ON THE PLANET. Description The Ka'iwi Channel Swim is a 28 mile, open water, island to island team swim race between the Hawaiian islands of Molokai and Oahu.  The start to finish approximate distance:  28 miles 24.5 Nautical Miles 45.25 Kilometers  The Ka'iwi Channel Swim Race is the most dangerous long distance swim on the planet. This race is like no other. This is ultimate proving ground. Increased dangers of this event exist beyond typical ocean swim events including rapidly changing weather conditions, and absolute remoteness where assistance or rescue is NOT guaranteed and should not be depended on. Logistics are complex. Its best to think this is part race and part expedition.  The race is scheduled to begin at Kaluako'i on the western side of Moloka'i and end at Sandy Beach Park on East Oahu on the other side of the notorious 28 mile Ka'iwi Channel.  We don't recommend this swim to anyone. BUT, if you understand the risks and still want to compete, I think we're all going to put meaning back in the term ""epic.""  Ka'iwi Channel is rightfully considered one of the most dangerous channels in the world and the ultimate decision to compete in this event should be heavily and carefully considered. Kaiwi Channel Association is a channel swimming governing body formed in 2013. The mission of the KCA is to establish and recognize individual AND relay swims that follow the standards of the KAIWI CHANNEL ASSOCIATION (between Molokai and Oahu). While other organizations will record individual crossings in other Hawaiian Channels, KCA records those of Kaiwi only. KCA also sponsors the Kaiwi Channel Swim Race held in August every year.   www.kaiwichannelassociation.com - Business Adviser for new Start-Up in the Medical Device Field - Determining proper growth strategies - Analyzing Opportunity and Opportunity Cost - Growing Pain Management - Business Formation San Francisco, CA, Honolulu, HI Solar Green Book is a software and solar PV startup.

The main tasks of a patent examiner are to search and examine patent applications received by the EPO. Patent applications are texts and drawings describing an invention and submitted by individuals or companies seeking legal protection.  The purpose of the search is to find the most relevant, previously published technical disclosures against which the patentability of the application may be assessed.  The substantive examination enables the applicant (or authorised representative such as a patent attorney) to be informed of any objections that may arise to the granting of a patent and to resolve these through correspondence and, where necessary, oral proceedings.  Another important task of an experienced patent examiner is the classification of published documents.  My technical fields of expertise are Sport Equipment and Footwear. During these years working as a Patent Examiner at the European Patent Office in The Hague, I have been thoroughly trained to become a Patent Examiner according to the very high standards demanded and delivered by the European Patent Office. I am now considered to be a fully trained European Patent Examiner. Besides, I have also been fully trained as a classifier of incoming documents, gaining insight in our classification scheme and a further global vision of the state of the art of my technical field of expertise.  My technical field of expertise is Sports Equipment (subclass A63B, according to the IPC and ECLA).  I have, therefore, learnt European Patent Law and enormously improved my technical knowledge in the field of Sports Equipment. My skills in languages and in international and interdisciplinary communication and collaboration have obviously also been exceptionally enhanced.  I have also been sent by my organisation to two technical missions, respectively to Norway (2008) and the West Coast of the USA (2009), during which I have visited and collaborated with state-of-the-art enterprises and inventors in the field of sports equipment. I was the direct assistant to the general manager responsible for the Centre and South parts of Spain; as such, I had to gain a global view of the enterprise as a whole and assist the general manager in coordinating and implementing. I also helped to improve the efficiency of some logistic processes.","Erasmus Exchange Programme, Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen, subjects recognized by University of Zaragoza; Ingeniero Industrial Superior, Industrial Engineering","; Universidad de Zaragoza","2005","German, Patents, English, French, Spanish, Dutch, Patentability, Intellectual Property, Patent Analysis, Fast Learning, Engineering, Patent Prosecution, Patent Applications, Patent Litigation, Patent Searching, Prosecution, Invention, Italian","11","Patents - Intellectual Property; Intellectual Property Professionals; European Patent Office; IP Legislation & Politics Observatory Group; EPO Opposition Practice; Post-Grant Patent Practice; European Intellectual Property Network; Premios Extraordinarios de Bachillerato; TED: Ideas Worth Spreading - Unofficial; CPS Alumni, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain; Patent Professionals","","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Male","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","","","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","0","0","0","Unknown","July 15 at 9:36am","21"," 2"," 0","0.07","0.83","0.59","Munich Area, Germany","2005"," 48"

The restructuring has taken less than a year and involved all regions from the Americas, Asia, India to Europe.  LM Wind Power's French customer Alstom was the first customer to receive the 2012 worlds longest blade of 73.5m by truck. A team consisting of members from my team in LM Wind Power, Alstom and the transport companies involved managed to deliver the prototype safely and without a single damage in time to the destination, despite unfavorable weather conditions.  The transformation project of Philips Television aimed at the preparation of the intended joint venture with another partner outside Philips. The aim to engage financially and from a manufacturing and sourcing point of view was to achieve scale effects and reduce the cost base for Philips Television to remain competitive in the market; a market which is more and more dominated by aggressive price strategies of predominantly Korean brands such as Samsung and LG. I had been leading the project to assess the outsourcing options of the sales and distribution teams for Television in the different European countries. This had been a very challenging task as the Philips sector Consumer Lifestyle of which Philips TV was a part of had just integrated all consumer activities less than 2 years back. The project delivered valuable insights and risk profiles allowing Philips to take the necessary decisions 2 years later to join into a joint venture with the Taiwanese partner, TP Vision.  In 2009 Philips Television launched the worlds first Television with the 21:9 aspect ratio to deliver the full cinematic viewing experience (""no more black bars on top and below the movie screen""). Our team of product management, R&D and Consumer Research (CMI) worked on this product since more than 2 years. It is based on the validated insight that people who like to watch movies at home don't like the "" black bars"" above and below the movie screen. Why not see the entire picture as the director intended to show it? This television was another innovation by Philips filling an unmet need of millions of movie lovers who watch movies at home. The link attached shows the viral online campaign ""Carrousel"" which made the television popular across entire Europe within weeks.  Philips Television has been amongst the first TV brands to launch a customized Internet access to its High End Television range in 2009 which allows the user to access multiple local and international services via the TV remote control by the push of a button. The business model included the partnering with several local and international content providers such as YouTube, Meteo Consult or E-bay. My objective with the team was to develop multiple partnerships with content providers and launch an online campaign to drive traffic to the Philips site and Philips customer outlets.   Philips and Nivea for Men (Beiersdorf AG, Hamburg) launched their award winning viral campaign in August 2007 for ""Cool Skin"", the new generation of electric moisturizing shavers to attract ""wet shavers"" to switch to ""electric shaving"". The team prepared for this launch for more than a year and in close cooperation with it's alliance partners from Nivea for Men.  Since the launch of it's first electric moisturizing shaver ""Cool Skin"" with the integrated Nivea for Men shaving emulsion in 1999 Philips had turned more than 50% of their target group to Philips Shaving. This campaign has become the most spoken viral campaign of it's year in the personal care market and released an online activation program allowing the introduction of a new business model to sell the Shaver and moisturizing lotion of Nivea fro Men through a wider distribution in FMCG and electric retail channels.   The introduction of ""Senseo"" in the German market has become the largest success of a single appliance to be introduced in the household appliances markets as well as in the FMCG retail channels in its time. I chaired the cooperation between Philips, Douwe Egberts (Raymond Bastiaens) and its distribution partner Genuport (Dr. Uwe Lebens) in which we managed to reach the highest weighted distribution of a single appliance in the history of Philips appliances and successfully listed the ""Senseo"" coffee pads in all major FMCG retail chains in Germany despite a dominating competition from brands such as Tschibo, Jacobs and Eduscho. The document attached summarizes the facts of the successful introduction of the unique Philips & Douwe Egberts patented single cup serving system "" Senseo"" into the German market for coffee, both in electric retail as well as in food retail.

The article, a follow-up from an earlier post on Chinese foreign aid and investment, highlights characteristics of aid flows from other important emerging donors.  Initial findings on a landscaping study of international remittances through mobile money, conducted by CGAP and Dalberg Global Development Advisors In the Paris Declaration of 2005, donors agreed to give money directly, and with fewer strings attached, to developing country governments, who in turn promised to improve their management and use of aid. Using data from the Paris Declaration Evaluation in 2011, we found two surprising findings. First, developing countries who implemented their Paris Declaration commitments did not see greater improvements in development indicators. Second, and more significant, donors did not give any more money to developing countries who did what was asked of them in the Paris Declaration.

This included building a database, developing relationships with partners and companies new to Cranfield and promoting innovative and exciting services and products as they come on stream.   The Operations Excellence Institute is a new enterprise within the Manufacturing theme at Cranfield which has three key strands: a) To facilitate innovation in learning offering 3D, virtual reality and augmented reality facilities together with world-class telepresence b) online learning through short modular programmes c) A Manufacturing Co-operative bringing together SMEs for procurement benefits and streamlined production. Much of my time was spent on the phone, researching and proactively brokering the introduction between TACK International and companies in UK and overseas, ranging from family-owned SMEs to Multi-national Plcs. I worked closely with the BDM team to produce outstanding training interventions with the ethos 'Learn it Today, Use it Tomorrow'.

Deze sociale/maatschappelijke bijdrage bestaat uit het inzetten van een bepaald aantal of percentage personen uit (potentieel) kwetsbare groepen bij het vervullen van de opdracht. Het doel van SROI is om zoveel mogelijk mensen die zonder re-integratiesteun niet of moeilijk aan het werk komen, aan werk of werkervaring te helpen. Het kan hierbij gaan om arbeids-, stage-, of leerwerkplekken.  Regio Matchpoint is een regionaal, intersectoraal mobiliteitsnetwerk van en voor bedrijven. Het doel is om de knelpunten op de regionale arbeidsmarkt, op korte en lange termijn, het hoofd te bieden door mobiliteit van medewerkers tussen bedrijven te vergroten. Dit kan zijn bij krapte, vacatures, boventalligheid, vrijwillige mobililteit, reintegratie of verzuim. In Regio Matchpoint worden vacatures, klussen, projecten, kennis en kandidaten uitgewisseld. Deelnemende bedrijven krijgen hierdoor goede mensen. En medewerkers worden mobieler en breder inzetbaar. Met als uitgangspunt Van Werk naar Werk. In het kader van het programma "" Castricum op weg naar 2016"" heb ik een marktplaats (Matchpoint) opgezet waar medewerkers en vacatures, projecten, klussen, stage- en werkervaringsplekken gematched worden.

I did a cost take-out project finding ~$25-30M in potential savings within a three year time horizon. I have sized the market for a med-tech product in 2018 creating business case for potential acquisition. I have also created a framework for sizing the value created by distributor relationships applicable across many industries and market dynamics.  I completed a sales organization diagnostic and implementation plan to enable significant growth in organization (2x profit) at a large global asset management firm. I recently lead a Commercial Middle Market bank sales force effectiveness project leading a pilot to test the initiative. It was so successful, we moved immediately into roll-out for the remaining teams. My first project at BCG was an internal research project investigating the intersection between product development and IT solutions. My second project is a company wide reorganization. I am looking at how that can be implemented while maintaining continuous business operations. My third project involved assessing a large IT transformation for an auto company and identifying risk areas. My fourth project helped a bank technology company identify areas of opportunity for operational improvement. My fifth project for an appliance manufacturer defined customer supply chain requirements and competitive landscape. I have also done work on a global delivery and sourcing project for a large US insurance company. I recently completed a commercial bank growth strategy for a regional bank.  I am currently the global Michigan Ross MBA specialist for the Class of 2015 With a team, I designed project to identify opportunities for inclusion of fund of hedge fund investments in institutional portfolios based on consultations with potential investors. I analyzed regulatory environment of six countries and market conditions of three countries to determine high priority countries for sales expansion. I collaborated closely with business users across 3 continents to produce process analysis of operations. From there, I identified key areas for improvement through reduction of custom reporting resulting in savings of ~$500,000 per year. I led a five member team in Tokyo through defining scope and monitoring progress implementing a new reporting structure in 10 days versus 7 months.","Master of Business Administration (MBA), Business; Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Computer Engineering","University of Michigan - Stephen M.

As part of our involvement in the 2014 Future Leaders Program (FLP) of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), our group project conducted research on how South African companies have put Integrated Reporting into practice. We interviewed four companies in South Africa, as well as the Chairman of the South African Integrated Reporting Committee (IRC), to understand their motivations and requirements for Integrated Reporting. Our objective was to share their insights on the process, the key lessons they learned, and what were the benefits and impacts. We also interviewed four South Africa-based institutional investors, who analyse these reports to make some of their investing decisions. We wanted to hear what they expect from these reports, and their advice on how to make them better.","MBA, Finance, Marketing.; Engineering, Cum Laude.; BS, Mathematics/Physics","Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business; Institut polytechnique de Grenoble; University Paul Sabatier Toulouse","2007","Business Development, Valuation, Emerging Markets, Equities, Management, Investments, Risk Management, Derivatives, Leadership, Fixed Income, Finance, Trading, Equity Research, Sales, Restructuring, Renewable Energy, Investor Relations, Consulting, Structured Products, Strategy, Capital Markets, Financial Analysis, Financial Modeling","43","Silicon Valley Venture Community; The SRI Conference; Duke University Alumni Network; Energy & Utilities Network; Sustainable Investing; Renewable Energy Network; The Duke MBA - Europe; Band of Entrepreneurs; Global Private Equity & Venture Capital; European Renewable Energy Forum; DukeGEN - The Duke Global Entrepreneurship Network - Main Group; Hedge Fund Group (HFG) Association: Alternative Investments, CTA Funds, & Fund of Funds; Renewables Job Market; Quant Linked Group (QLG: Wall Street Quants); The Carbon Professionals Networking Group; Linked:Energy (Energy industry expertise); Power, Utilities & Renewables Group; ESG Investing in Europe; ; Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Network - The #1 Group for CFOs; European Investors Group; ESG Research; Advanced Energy Economy: the business voice of advanced energy; Venture Capital Group; Global Renewable Energy Network (GReEN); VCIC; French MBAs Abroad; ESG in the United States; Socially Responsible Investing (2576342); Duke University's Fuqua School of Business Alumni; Link to Commodities; ORSYP Alumni; Cleantech Investor; Renewable Energy Jobs - Powered by www.RenewableEnergyJobs.com; On Startups - The Community For Entrepreneurs; FierceFinance Exchange; ESG Investing; WBCSD Future Leaders Program Alumni; Facebook User Group; Electric Utility Professionals; Investor Relations Network; Carbon Career Network; Global Energy Sales Network","","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 3"," 3","0.50","0.07","0.08","Paris Area, France","2007","167"

This touches areas such as learning, coaching, mentoring, skills assessments and analysis, etc. Since mid 2010 I am on assignment in Shanghai, China.  In my role I am responsible for the Sales & Industry Learning course delivery across the GMU. My team consists of Learning Program Managers, and Learning Facilitators, all spread across the various GMT's.  The Learning Program Managers are ensuring the planning and execution of the learning offerings runs according to plan and meets the necessary quality measures.  The Learning Facilitators are our teachers that are increasingly being developed in order to be able to deliver all of our courses across the globe.  I was brought in to ensure a smooth transition from my predecessor while making sure we stayed on target in light of our Sales Eminence rollout for Global Sales School and First Line Sales Manager. All targets were met successfully in 2010 and remain on track throughout 2011.  Over the past year I have build up our organizational structure in GMU, ensuring it aligns with the Major Market one which I established in my prior role. We now have a globally consistent structure which allows us to more efficiently and effectively role out our course offerings across the globe.  Prior to taking on this role I built up a diverse and versatile career path in IBM, working and evolving quickly within each department :  10/2008 - 04/2010 : IST Sales & Industry Learning Pillar Leader Major Markets 01/2007 - 09/2008 : Learning Manager Sales & Marketing pan-IOT 06/2005 - 12/2006 : eServer Sales Manager for STG 06/2001 - 06/2005 : IBM Forum Manager and Marketing Events 06/2000 - 06/2001 : Executive Assistant of Country General Manager Belgium 01/1998 - 06/2000 : EMEA Direct Marketing Manager Printing Systems 01/1997 - 12/1997 : Region West Distributed Printing Product Manager 01/1996 - 12/1996 : Channel representative Printing Systems 02/1995 - 12/1995 : Telesales Printing Systems 02/1994 - 02/1995 : System Administrator AS/400 Reorganisation of old sales and industry learning setup to align with the new IST structure Bring together Europe, North America and Japan to create major markets collaboration Building organisational structure First experience in 2nd line management First experience in management outside European borders As an eSM you are responsible for all the STG business within a specific set of clients. I covered a selected set of accounts within the Distribution/Industry cluster. This assignment gave me the opportunity to build up project management skills when we installed the IBM Forum in La Hulpe, and later on moved it to Brussels. Throughout this effort I worked intensively with all departments within IBM in order to ensure their buy in into the new customer center (including presence through demo booths and marketing material). It was a learning experience to work with a lot of external vendors and establish a correct level of communication and commitment with them to ensure the end result met expectations. This was also my first people management experience. During my time as IBM Forum Manager I managed to revitalise the team and attract new talent into the team. Project Contribution:Project management (coordinate concept and construction of IBM Forum in La Hulpe and later in Brussels) First people management experience Organisation of ""Linux is Everywhere"" event in Heyzel for +/- 500 clients and BP's.

My initial goal was to re-focus the activity of the company around products and solutions for logistics applications. Vividot (a US based subsidiary of ImageID, dealing with event-based marketing) was sold in 2007. Logistics product offering (SW and HW) expanded from vision-based readers to complete traceability solutions with price range of $100K-$500K. A mixed direct and indirect Sales strategy focused on large industrial organizations. Specifically, our products gained momentum with food suppliers of major retailers in Europe, as well as in USA and Japan. Our largest customer has purchased well over $6M worth of our products and services. Following the 2008 crisis, it was decided to sell the company. The process, led by me, included cost cutting and employee reduction, as well as self-financing achieved by selling IP (~$1.5M). The selling process was completed in less than a year, with the acquisition of ImageID by a leading European player in the AIDC market (Zetes Industries: http://www.zetes.com) at the end of 2009. Today, ImageID serves as a product division of Zetes based in Israel. I have left ImageID with the conclusion of the sale to Zetes. Managed Latin America Sales out of NYC office during 1994-1996.

A multinational organisation wanted to offer maternity coaching: a proven aid to talent management, and a valuable support for women at a time of radical change in their lives.  I carried out a series of interviews to discover how maternity was affecting both the organisation and its key female staff, to learn what they wanted from the coaching, and to agree clear business-linked objectives.   I then developed a programme that addressed these needs, offering a number of scheduled, one-to-one phone calls and meetings with each coachee, starting before the maternity leave and continuing after the return to work.   Both client and coachees were delighted with the results. The coachees said that the programme helped them to handle this life change more easily, while the organisation found that it helped them to retain and motivate their valuable staff.  I now offer specialist maternity coaching programmes to a wide range of organisations, fully tailored to the needs of both business and the coachees.","Certificate in Coaching; Law Society Finals, Law; BA, Psychology and Law","Henley Business School; Guildford College of Law; University of Cape Town","2008","Employment Law, Coaching, Executive coaching, Maternity coaching, Leadership Development, Learning & Development, Management development, HR consulting, HR coaching, Mentoring, Executive Coaching, Management Development, Human Resources, Recruiting, Training, Training Delivery, HR Coaching, HR Consulting, MBTI, Management","8","Linked:HR Global; Executive coaching; International Society for Coaching Psychology: An international professional body; Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer - Past and Present; HR Organizational Learning & Development; HR Manager Talent Solutions; Acas Employee Relations and HR advice; HR Professionals Association - Human Resources","","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 1"," 2","0.50","0.63","0.30","London, United Kingdom","2008","271"

Developing eHealth/HIT oriented social entrepreneurship partnerships and joint ventures.  Building shared learning and research networks in Germany, the EU, and abroad, with a focus on connectivity, digital therapies, personalised health care, population health management.  Health care innovation jury member. This being a part-time affiliation, I continue to offer consulting services as described below. Public speaking re the German health care system, recent reforms in pharmaceutical pricing, integrated care, innovation. I also cover U.S. health care reform implementation with a view to provider payment mechanisms and strategies towards care coordination, or primary care developments in Europe. I've also facilitated high-level health study visits to Germany, the U.S., Spain, and the Netherlands. A focus on my work is bilateral knowledge transfer in health care regulation and innovation, via expert networking and bringing together the right people. Occasionally authoring papers and issue briefs on the above topics. I speak and write in English, German, and Spanish. Federal level policy networking, public relations, media partnerships, grant proposal writing, EU project consortia Hello, next week I'll be facilitating the kick-off to KBV's 4th Annual Fair on Health Care Innovations in Berlin. The event is offering a forum for physician organizations, networks, and multi-specialty groups from German-speaking countries to display their work and experiences in collaborating together - around populations, indications, and across specialities, professions, and settings, using incentives, public reporting, technologies, and larger teams.  This year, we're broading the scope and outreach beyond Germany, looking into what other countries are doing: There will be a presentation on the Dutch diabetes care groups and how providers are managing bundled payments to improve quality, coordination, and efficiency. Another report from the field will talk about recent pilots in France, where primary care providers are assuming responsibility at the regional level. Last but not least, we'll hear from the U.S. - a review about care coordination incentives in the Affordable Care Act with its avalanche of pilots and demonstrations cutting across all sorts of delivery and insurance markets alike. I thought this might be interesting last-minute for some of you. Happy to announce that our Horizon2020 research proposal submitted under the PHC*23 Call ""Developing and comparing new models for safe and efficient, prevention oriented health and care systems"" got selected for EU-support and implementation for four years!! Chances were 15%, and our eight-country, VUMC-led consortium is all set to studying integrated care approaches for the elderly - and sharing findings about best practice and replicability. The project title is SUSTAIN ""Sustainable tailored integrated care for older people in Europe"". More to come!  *Note that in EU jargon, PHC stands for Personalised Health and Care, not Primary Health Care.
