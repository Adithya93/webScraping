Interxion follows a very focussed strategy that aims to add value to our customers by building profitable communities of interest in our data centres that benefit our customers greatly and allow them to grow their business.   My role is to continue with and expand on that strategy and further grow the UK business of Interxion. The Data Centre Alliance (DCA) is a professional Association comprising of Industry leaders from across the Data Centre Industry. It represents the date centre industry to the business world, the media, governments and the general public.  The DCA is an independent not-for-profit organisation run by and for the industry, open to all operators of data centres and server rooms however large or small.  In addition to promoting the adoption of best practice design and operational standards, our primary role is to act as a Accreditation Body for these standards.  The objective of the DCA is also to provide members with exclusive access to advice, guidance and academically peer reviewed documentation.   The DCA is committed to feeding expertise and experience from across the industry into academia and higher educational programmes to ensure the future health, growth and sustainability of the industry. Within the Colt Executive Committee I am responsible for the entire Data Centre portfolio across the Group. The current Data Centre footprint consists of 20 Data Centres accross 10 countries in Europe with sites in all the major cities in Europe. 2012 revenues across the Data Centre Services Unit amounted to ca. Eur 105m.   Given the quality of the data centres, the strategic locations and Colt's ability to deliver new Data Centres on customer premises where needed with guaranteed (short!) delivery times, the focus will now be on integrating the data centre portfolio into the overall Colt portfolio. The seamless integration of Colt's IT, network and data centre services will offer customers the ability to optimize their IT strategy in a way that is second to none. This optimisation will not only lead to reduced operating costs but also to a more effective and efficient IT infrastructure.

Responsible for managing and growing the Dutch subsidiary of Redbus Interhouse PLC, a UK public company that is traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. I took the company from start up to profitability in extremely tough market conditions. I was involved in the start-up of the Dutch subsidiary of TELES AG, a German company traded on the TecDAX. At first as Sales Manager and at a later stage after more than 2 very successful years promoted to Managing Director of the Dutch subsidiary. This was followed a year later by the additional appointment as ad interim Managing Director of 2 French subsidiaries of TELES AG, where the main focus was on restructuring rather than day-to-day management.","Blue Ocean Strategy; Bachelor's Degree, Marketing/Marketing Management, NIMA A and B; Bc, Information Sciences","INSEAD; NIMA - Netherlands Institute for Marketing; De Haagse Hogeschool / The Hague University of Applied Sciences","2012","Data Center, Management, Start-ups, Managed Services, Leadership, Integration, Cloud Computing, Strategy, New Business Development, Telecommunications, Outsourcing, Networking, Infrastructure, IT Strategy, SaaS, Solution Selling, Mergers & Acquisitions, Security, Cash Management, Product Management, Acquisition Integration, Driving Growth, Mergers","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA," 2"," 3","1",NA,NA,"0.46","0.11"

Targeting my member is now going to be a much more precise exercise.  Thank you Lindsey for helping us navigate all this with gusto ! Selena has been my right hand at MEC since day one. She has a very unique mix of strong strategic sense with the ability to create some strong operational programs.  She brings in a very keen sense of research , and set up a 5000 member panel which has been instrumental in allowing us to develop more targeted prograns for our members  Maria and I have worked together several times , in particular we presented at a conference on the topic of community marketing and how both her brand Nature Path and MEC had become quite adept at creating a large community of loyal followers.  We also taught a class together at UBC on Green marketing and how the efforts done by our two companies in terms of sustainability ultimately helped the brand in its marketing efforts , building credibility, loyalty and a high level of engagement of our customers.  Both times I have found Maria to be a very skilled communicator, very thorough in her preparation and a lot of fun to work with .  Can't wait for a new opportunity to happen ! I am very happy to be able to recommend Charlotte and her work at Patagonia as Marketing Assistant for the UK market . Charlotte started as an intern and her vivacious personality , her superb implementation talent made her quickly a legitimate part of the Marketing department.  Charlotte was responsible for all communication and marketing activities for the UK market. She liaised with customer service which allowed her to quickly understand the business. Under her leadership the contacts with the Press in the UK multiplied and projected a very positive image for Patagonia.","IEP 2001, International Executive program ( General management); Master's degree (CAPES), Foreign languages","INSEAD; ","2001","Corporate Communications, Strategy, Public Relations, Marketing Communications, Marketing, Strategic Communications, E-commerce, Marketing Strategy, Management, Team Building, Direct Marketing, Branding & Identity, Leadership, Strategic Planning, Social Media, Internal Communications, Event Management, Web Strategy, French, Corporate Social..., Retail, Brand Development, Sales, Online Marketing, Business Strategy, Advertising, Social Media Marketing, Brand Management, Program Management, Digital Marketing, Team Management, retail, Mountain Products","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown","Unknown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"La capitale mondiale de l'autopartage - LaPresse+ http://t.co/9mUzKniAnd via @lp_lapresse
